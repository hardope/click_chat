## Design & Development

Design and development of a full scale social media patform Using Python flask web framework.<br>

This web app enables users to create text and picture posts and comments which can be liked and unliked. The comment section is multi layered as each comment can can aslo have a comment.<br>

Each user has a username and password, and after account creation, each user can upload a profile picture and give details about themselves like their sex and bio.<br>
